# Secure Headless Wallet Framework

This framework provides a secure, headless wallet solution designed for integration with frontend applications. It prioritizes security by handling sensitive operations on the backend and leveraging API keys, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), and MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication).

## Architecture

The framework employs a backend service (e.g., Flask) that manages wallet creation, balance retrieval, transaction processing, and other sensitive actions. Frontend applications (e.g., React) interact with this backend through secure API calls.

## Security Features

* **API Keys:** Used for initial authentication and identification of the frontend application.
* **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):**  Provides secure authentication and authorization for individual users. JWTs are issued upon successful login and used for subsequent API calls.
* **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication):** Adds an extra layer of security for critical operations like transaction signing.  This implementation uses TOTP (Time-based One-Time Passwords), compatible with Google Authenticator and similar apps.
* **Backend Key Management:** Private keys are handled exclusively on the backend, never exposed to the frontend.  Encryption at rest is employed, and more advanced solutions like hardware security modules (HSMs) or multi-party computation (MPC) can be integrated for enhanced security.

## Frontend Integration

Frontend applications interact with the backend API using standard HTTP requests.  API keys and JWTs are included in request headers for authentication and authorization.  The framework is designed to be compatible with various frontend technologies, such as React.

## API Endpoints


| Endpoint          | Method | Description                                           | Authentication        |
|-------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| `/api/register`   | POST   | Registers a new user.                               | None                  |
| `/api/login`      | POST   | Logs in a user and returns a JWT.                    | None                  |
| `/api/create_wallet` | POST   | Creates a new wallet for the authenticated user.     | JWT, User Password    |
| `/api/setup_mfa`  | POST   | Sets up or overwrites MFA for the authenticated user. | JWT                   |
|  *(Other wallet operations endpoints)* |  GET/POST etc.  | e.g., get balance, send transaction, etc. | JWT, potentially MFA |



## Database Migrations
Database schema migrations are managed using SQL scripts located in the `migrations/versions` directory.  The `apply_migrations` function in the backend code automatically applies new migrations upon application startup. Each migration file is versioned numerically, allowing only new schema changes to be applied.



## Development and Deployment

* **Local Development:** For local development, PostgreSQL is used.  The Cloud SQL Auth proxy is used for secure connections to Cloud SQL instances during development.
* **Production:**  Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL) is recommended for production due to its security features, scalability, and managed services.



## Security Best Practices

* **HTTPS:**  Always use HTTPS in production to secure communication between the frontend and backend.
* **Input Validation:** Validate all user inputs thoroughly to prevent vulnerabilities.
* **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding guidelines to minimize vulnerabilities.
* **Regular Security Audits:**  Perform regular security audits and penetration testing.

## Future Enhancements

* **HSM Integration:** Integrate with a Hardware Security Module (HSM) for more robust key management.
* **MPC Implementation:** Implement Multi-Party Computation (MPC) for enhanced key security.
* **More Sophisticated Frontend Integration:** Include frontend libraries/SDKs for easier integration.
